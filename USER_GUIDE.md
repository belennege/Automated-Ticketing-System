### **2️⃣ USER_GUIDE.md**

```markdown
# User Guide

## Program Flow
1. Launch `main.py`
2. Enter starting station (case-insensitive)
3. Enter destination station (must be different)
4. Program validates inputs
5. Ticket details displayed: start, destination, zones crossed, total fare

## Notes
- Empty or invalid inputs will prompt the user again
- Correct spelling improves speed, but input is case-insensitive
